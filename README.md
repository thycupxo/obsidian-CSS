# Obsidian-CSS

CSS snippets used in Obsidian. Most of the snippets are incoporated in the 'Obsidian-Custom-Atom-Theme-CSS-Snippet.css' file. 

In this file, 
I have applied custom font color and minor tweaks. The following snippets are applied:
- Clutter Free Headings
- Applied various CSS snippets to customize the current Atom theme:
	- Editor font: Make thicker so it is like in Preview
	- Unordered lists: turn into bullets as you type
	- Colored headings for editor and preview, same font-weight in Edit & Preview
	- Added bigger link popup preview
	- Added bullet point relationship lines
	- Hide URLs in Edit mode
	- Stylish Block Quotes
	- Relationship lines for files/folders and bullet points

I do not create these css snippets. They are collected from other GitHub repos and I simply just want to keep these files on GitHub in case it helps other people.
All credits go to the orginal creators. Thank you so much for creating! :)
